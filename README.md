# Electronic labbooks

This repository contains the source code to compile a presentation on electronic labbooks.

To compile* yourself, you need to install ```reveal-md```. See [here for installation instructions](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md). 

* Compilation means conversion of the Markdown file into a static HTML page.
